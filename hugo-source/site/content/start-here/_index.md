# Backstory

I am old OpenBSD fan and the thrill still continues. I used to maintain
ports in OpenBSD and I am also into Linux.

I am a command line geek and write text mails in [vim
editor](https://www.vim.org) and use [mutt](http://www.mutt.org) for my
email traffic.

No , I don't use Gmail. My email server is hosted in
[Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com)

As such I am an easy going guy with a geek mindset.

## Current status

Being a digital nomad I really have plenty of time or no time at all. I
have never worked in a regular job since May 18, 2005.

I actively work on my E-mail threat control product
[SpamCheetah](https://www.spamcheetah.com), a B2B SAAS product.

If you operate your own E-mail server you must give it a shot.

I also maintain [LiveUSB OpenBSD](https://liveusb-openbsd.sourceforge.io) that gives you a bootable UNIX on a USB pendrive.

In addition I keep working on growing my [Twitter
audience](https://twitter.com/girish1729).

I interview people on Twitter. If you wish to be interviewed just send
me a DM.

## I also do consulting for tech companies
