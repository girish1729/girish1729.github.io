# Welcome to Github home of Girish Venkatachalam

I am old OpenBSD fan and the thrill still continues. I used to maintain
ports in OpenBSD and I am also into Linux.

I am a command line geek and write text mails in [vim
editor](https://www.vim.org) and use [mutt](http://www.mutt.org) for my
email traffic.

No , I don't use Gmail. My email server is hosted in
[Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com)

As such I am an easy going guy with a geek mindset.

## Other

Being a digital nomad I really have plenty of time or no time at all. I
have never worked in a regular job since May 18, 2005.
