# Backstory

I am old OpenBSD fan and the thrill still continues. I used to maintain
ports in OpenBSD and I am also into Linux.

I am a command line geek and write text mails in [vim
editor](https://www.vim.org) and use [mutt](http://www.mutt.org) for my
email traffic.

No , I don't use Gmail. My email server is hosted in
[Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com)

My name got into [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSSH)
somehow.I am sure it was a mistake.

Check the 4th reference, that is my article.

I have been working on TCP/IP networking protocols, cryptography(not
crypto currency or blockchain) and I have worked on several things in my
long programmer life of 24 years.

I have written close to 5 cover stories on LinuxJournal back in 2008 on
topics like 
  
  * [P2P NAT traversal using UDP holepunching](https://linuxjournal.com/article/9004)
  * [Multimedia with mplayer](https://linuxjournal.com/article/9787)
  * [OpenSSH](https://linuxjournal.com/article/9566)
  * [Image processing](https://linuxjournal.com/article/9696)
  * [C programming for high performance sockets](https://linuxjournal.com/article/9815)

## Consulting for tech topics

In my long exposure to various technologies and my startup experience I
offer value for others looking to do something in this new Internet
creator economy.

## Current status

Being a digital nomad I really have plenty of time or no time at all. I
have never worked in a regular job since May 18, 2005.

I actively work on my E-mail threat control product
[SpamCheetah](https://www.spamcheetah.com), a B2B SAAS product.

If you operate your own E-mail server you must give it a shot.

I also maintain [LiveUSB OpenBSD](https://liveusb-openbsd.sourceforge.io) that gives you a bootable UNIX on a USB pendrive. 

I developed this around 2010 or so and still people use it.

In addition I keep working on growing my [Twitter
audience](https://twitter.com/girish1729).

I interview people on Twitter. If you wish to be interviewed just send
me a [DM](https://twitter.com/girish1729).
